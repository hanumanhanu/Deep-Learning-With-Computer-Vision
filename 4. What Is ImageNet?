4.1 The ImageNet Dataset

 ImageNet is actually a project aimed at labeling
and categorizing images into all its 22,000 categories based on a defined set of words and phrases.
At the time of this writing, there are over 14 million images in the ImageNet project.

4.1.1 ILSVRC

ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge [9], or
simply ILSVRC for short. The goal of the image classification track in this challenge is to train a
model that can correctly classify an image into 1,000 separate object categories, some of which are
considered fine-grained classification and others which are not. 
Images inside the ImageNet datasetwere gathered by compiling previous datasets and scraping popular online websites. These images
were then manually labeled, annotated, and tagged.

4.2 Obtaining ImageNet

The ImageNet classification challenge dataset is quite large, weighing in at 138GB for the training
images, 6.3GB for the validation images, and 13GB for the testing images. Before you can
download ImageNet, you first need to obtain access to the ILSVRC challenge and download the
images and associated class labels. This section will help you obtain the ImageNet dataset.

4.2.1 Requesting Access to the ILSVRC Challenge

Once you’ve accepted the Terms of Access you’ll have access to the Download Original
Images page – click the ILSVRC 2015 image data link. From there make sure you download
the Development Kit, a .zip file containing a README, information on the training/testing splits,
blacklisted files that should not be used for training, etc. (Figure 4.3).
You’ll then want to download the CLS-LOC dataset which contains the 1.2 million images in
the ImageNet dataset (Figure 4.3). Keep in mind that this is a large file and depending on your
internet connection (and the stability of image-net.org), this download may take a couple of days.
My personal suggestion would be to use the wget command line program to download the archive,
enabling you to restart the download from where you left off, just in case there are connectivity
issues (which there are likely to be a handful of). Explaining how to use wget is outside the scope
of this book, so please refer to the following page for instructions on how to restart a download
with wget (http://pyimg.co/97u59).

4.2.2 Downloading Images Programmatically

: To download the entire ImageNet dataset you’ll need to download the development kit
along with the large .tar archive of the ≈ 1.2million images. (highlighted with red rectangles).
does not “own” the images inside the dataset so they can freely distribute the URLs of the images.
The URLs of every image (a .txt file with one URL per line) in the dataset can be found here:

Again, you would need to use wget to download the images. A common problem you may
encounter here is that some image URLs may have naturally 404’d since the original web crawl and
you won’t have access to them. Therefore, downloading the images programmatically can be quite
cumbersome, tedious, and a method I do not recommend. But don’t fret – there is another way to
obtain ImageNet.

4.2.3 Using External Services
The testing set is not included in the torrent as we will not have access to the ImageNet
evaluation server to submit our predictions on the testing data. Please keep in mind that even if you
do use external services such as AcademicTorrents to download the ImageNet dataset, you are still
implicitly bound to the Terms of Access. 

4.2.4 ImageNet Development Kit

The DevKit contains:
• An overview and statistics for the dataset.
• Meta data for the categories (allowing us to build our image filename to class label mappings).
• MATLAB routines for evaluation (which we will not need).

4.2.5 ImageNet Copyright Concerns

• Asset #1: The images themselves.
• Asset #2: The pre-compiled ILSVRC dataset.
• Asset #3: The output model weights obtained by training a network on ILSVRC.

My Anecdotal Opinion
It is my anecdotal opinion that there is an unspoken set of rules that govern the fair usage of
the ImageNet dataset. I believe these rules to be as follows (although there are sure to be many
who disagree with me):
• Rule #1: You need to obtain the ILSVRC dataset by some means and accept (either explicitly
or implicitly) the Terms of Access.
• Rule #2: After obtaining the data associated with the ILSVRC challenge, you need to train
your own Convolutional Neural Network on the dataset. You are free to use existing network
architectures such as AlexNet, VGGNet, ResNet, etc. provided that you train the network
from scratch on the ILSVRC dataset. You do not need to develop a novel network architecture.
• Rule #3: Once you have obtained your model weights, you can then distribute them under
your own restrictions, including open access, usage with attribution, and even limited commercial usage.
