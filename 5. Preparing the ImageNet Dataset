5.1 Understanding the ImageNet File Structure

$ tar -xvf ILSVRC2015_CLS-LOC.tar.gz

Once the tarball has finished uncompressing, you’ll have a directory named ILSVRC2015:
$ ls ILSVRC2015

Let’s go ahead and change directory into ILSVRC2015 and list the contents, where you’ll find
three sub-directories:
$ cd ILSVRC2015
$ ls

Annotations Data ImageSets
First, we have the Annotations directory. This directory is only used for the localization
challenge (i.e., object detection), so we can ignore this directory.

The Data directory is more important. Inside Data we’ll find a sub-directory named CLS-LOC:
$ ls Data/
CLS-LOC

Here we can find the training, testing, and validation “splits”:
$ ls Data/CLS-LOC/
test train val

I put the word “splits” in quotations as there is still work that needs to be done in order to
get this data in a format such that we can train a Convolutional Neural Network on it and obtain
state-of-the-art classification results.

5.1.1 ImageNet “test” Directory

The test directory contains (as the name applies) 100,000 images (100 data points for each of the
1,000 classes) for our testing split:
$ ls -l Data/CLS-LOC/test/ | head -n 10

5.1.3 ImageNet “val” Directory
Similar to the test directory, the val directory contains 50,000 images per class (50 images for
each of the 1,000 classes):

$ ls -l Data/CLS-LOC/val/*.JPEG | wc -l
50000

$ ls -l Data/CLS-LOC/val/ | head -n 10
total 6648996

5.1.4 ImageNet “ImageSets” Directory

$ ls
Annotations Data ImageSets
$ cd ImageSets/
$ ls
CLS-LOC
$ cd CLS-LOC
$ ls
test.txt train_cls.txt train_loc.txt val.txt

$ wc -l train_cls.txt val.txt
1281167 train_cls.txt
50000 val.txt
1331167 total

$ head -n 10 train_cls.txt

ILSVRC2012_val_00000010 10

5.1.5 ImageNet “DevKit” Directory

$ tar -xvf ILSVRC2015_devkit.tar.gz
Inside the ILSVRC2015 directory you’ll find the directory we are looking for – devkit:
$ cd ILSVRC2015
$ ls
devkit

I
would suggest you copy the devkit directory so that it lives with our Annotations, Data, and
ImageSets directories as well:
$ cp -R ~/home/ILSVRC2015/devkit /raid/datasets/imagenet/

the contents of devkit:
$ cd devkit/
$ ls
COPYING data evaluation readme.txt

Most importantly, we have the data directory. Inside data you’ll find a number of metafiles,
both in MATLAB and plain text (.txt) format:
$ cd data/
$ ls -l
total 2956
ILSVRC2015_clsloc_validation_blacklist.txt
ILSVRC2015_clsloc_validation_ground_truth.mat
ILSVRC2015_clsloc_validation_ground_truth.txt
ILSVRC2015_det_validation_blacklist.txt
ILSVRC2015_det_validation_ground_truth.mat
ILSVRC2015_vid_validation_ground_truth.mat
map_clsloc.txt
map_det.txt
map_vid.txt
meta_clsloc.mat
meta_det.mat
meta_vid.mat
From this directory, we are most concerned with the following three files:
• map_clsloc.txt
• ILSVRC2015_clsloc_validation_ground_truth.txt
• ILSVRC2015_clsloc_validation_blacklist.txt
The map_clsloc.txt file maps our WordNet IDs to human readable class labels and is,
therefore, the easiest method to convert a WordNet ID to a label a human can interpret. Listing the
first few lines of this file, we can see the mappings themselves:
$ head -n 10 map_clsloc.txt
n02119789 1 kit_fox
n02100735 2 English_setter
n02110185 3 Siberian_husky
n02096294 4 Australian_terrier
n02102040 5 English_springer
n02066245 6 grey_whale
n02509815 7 lesser_panda
n02124075 8 Egyptian_cat
n02417914 9 ibex
n02123394 10 Persian_cat

. The val.txt file lists the (partial) image filenames for the validation set. There are exactly 50,000 entries (on per line) in the val.txt file. There
are also 50,000 entries (one per line) inside ILSVRC2015_clsloc_validation_ground_truth.txt.
Let’s take a look at these entries:
$ head -n 10 ILSVRC2015_clsloc_validation_ground_truth.txt
490
361
171
822
297
482
13
704
599
164
As we can see, there is a single integer listed on each line. Taking the first line of val.txt and
the first line of ILSVRC2015_clsloc_validation_ground_truth.txt we end up with:
(ILSVRC2012_val_00000001, 490)

$ grep ’ 490 ’ map_clsloc.txt
n01751748 490 sea_snake
Therefore, we need to use both val.txt and ILSVRC2015_clsloc_validation_ground_truth.txt
to build our validation set.

Let’s also examine the contents of ILSVRC2015_clsloc_validation_blacklist.txt:
$ head -n 10 ILSVRC2015_clsloc_validation_blacklist.txt
36

5.2 Building the ImageNet Dataset

From there, we’ll define a Python class named ImageNetHelper which will enable us to
quickly and easily build:
1. Our .lst files for the training, testing, and validation split. Each line in a .lst file contains
the unique image ID, class label, and the full path to the input image. We’ll then be able to
use these .lst files in conjunction with the mxnet tool im2rec to convert our image files to
an efficiently packed record file.
2. Our mean Red, Green, and Blue channel averages for the training set which we’ll later use
when performing mean normalization.

5.2.1 Your First ImageNet Configuration File
Whenever training a CNN on ImageNet, we’ll create a project with the following directory structure:
--- mx_imagenet_alexnet
| |--- config
| | |--- __init__.py
| | |--- imagnet_alexnet_config.py
| |--- imagenet
| |--- output/
| |--- build_imagenet.py
| |--- test_alexnet.py
| |--- train_alexnet.py

e (1) the full path to the lists directory and (2) the sym-link version:
• /raid/datasets/imagenet/lists
• imagenet/lists (which points to the full /raid path above)
To create your own sym-links (in a Unix-based environment) you can use the ln command.
The example command below will create a symbolic link named imagenet in my current working
directory which links to the full ImageNet dataset in my /raid drive:
$ ln -s /raid/datasets/imagenet imagenet

Regardless of where you choose to store your base ImageNet dataset directory, take the time
now to create two subdirectories – lists and rec:
$ mkdir imagenet/lists
$ mkdir imagenet/rec

# import the necessary packages
from os import path

# define the base path to where the ImageNet dataset
# devkit are stored on disk)
BASE_PATH = "/raid/datasets/imagenet/ILSVRC2015"
# based on the base path, derive the images base path, image sets
 # path, and devkit path
IMAGES_PATH = path.sep.join([BASE_PATH, "Data/CLS-LOC"])
IMAGE_SETS_PATH = path.sep.join([BASE_PATH, "ImageSets/CLS-LOC/"])
DEVKIT_PATH = path.sep.join([BASE_PATH, "devkit/data"])
# define the path that maps the 1,000 possible WordNet IDs to the
# class label integers
WORD_IDS = path.sep.join([DEVKIT_PATH, "map_clsloc.txt"])
# define the paths to the training file that maps the (partial)
# image filename to integer class label
TRAIN_LIST = path.sep.join([IMAGE_SETS_PATH, "train_cls.txt"])
Next, we need to define some validation configurations:
# define the paths to to the validation filenames along with the
# file that contains the ground-truth validation labels
VAL_LIST = path.sep.join([IMAGE_SETS_PATH, "val.txt"])
2VAL_LABELS = path.sep.join([DEVKIT_PATH,"ILSVRC2015_clsloc_validation_ground_truth.txt"])
# define the path to the validation files that are blacklisted
VAL_BLACKLIST = path.sep.join([DEVKIT_PATH,"ILSVRC2015_clsloc_validation_blacklist.txt"])
# since we do not have access to the testing data we need to
# take a number of images from the training data and use it instead
NUM_CLASSES = 1000
NUM_TEST_IMAGES = 50 * NUM_CLASSES
# define the path to the output training, validation, and testing
# lists
MX_OUTPUT = "/raid/datasets/imagenet"
TRAIN_MX_LIST = path.sep.join([MX_OUTPUT, "lists/train.lst"])
VAL_MX_LIST = path.sep.join([MX_OUTPUT, "lists/val.lst"])
TEST_MX_LIST = path.sep.join([MX_OUTPUT, "lists/test.lst"])
# define the path to the output training, validation, and testing
# image records
TRAIN_MX_REC = path.sep.join([MX_OUTPUT, "rec/train.rec"])
VAL_MX_REC = path.sep.join([MX_OUTPUT, "rec/val.rec"])
TEST_MX_REC = path.sep.join([MX_OUTPUT, "rec/test.rec"])
# define the path to the dataset mean
DATASET_MEAN = "output/imagenet_mean.json"
# define the batch size and number of devices used for training
BATCH_SIZE = 128
NUM_DEVICES = 8

5.2.2 Our ImageNet Helper Utility

# import the necessary packages
import numpy as np
import os
class ImageNetHelper:
def __init__(self, config):
# store the configuration object
self.config = config
# build the label mappings and validation blacklist
self.labelMappings = self.buildClassLabels()
self.valBlacklist = self.buildBlackist()
def buildClassLabels(self):
# load the contents of the file that maps the WordNet IDs
# to integers, then initialize the label mappings dictionary
rows = open(self.config.WORD_IDS).read().strip().split("\n")
labelMappings = {}
# loop over the labels
for row in rows:
# split the row into the WordNet ID, label integer, and
# human readable label
(wordID, label, hrLabel) = row.split(" ")

# update the label mappings dictionary using the word ID
# as the key and the label as the value, subtracting ‘1‘
# from the label since MATLAB is one-indexed while Python
# is zero-indexed
labelMappings[wordID] = int(label) - 1

# return the label mappings dictionary
return labelMappings
def buildBlackist(self):
# load the list of blacklisted image IDs and convert them to
# a set
rows = open(self.config.VAL_BLACKLIST).read()
rows = set(rows.strip().split("\n"))
# return the blacklisted image IDs
return rows
def buildTrainingSet(self):
# load the contents of the training input file that lists
# the partial image ID and image number, then initialize
# the list of image paths and class labels
rows = open(self.config.TRAIN_LIST).read().strip()
rows = rows.split("\n")
paths = []
labels = []

On Line 48 we load the entire contents of the TRAIN_LIST file and break it into rows on
Line 49. Recall that the TRAIN_LIST file contains the partial image file paths – a sample of the
train_cls.txt file can be seen below:
n01440764/n01440764_10969 91
n01440764/n01440764_10979 92
n01440764/n01440764_10995 93
n01440764/n01440764_11011 94
n01440764/n01440764_11018 95
n01440764/n01440764_11044 96
n01440764/n01440764_11063 97
n01440764/n01440764_11085 98
n01440764/n01440764_1108 99
n01440764/n01440764_1113 100

# loop over the rows in the input training file
for row in rows:
# break the row into the partial path and image
 # number (the image number is sequential and is
# essentially useless to us)
(partialPath, imageNum) = row.strip().split(" ")
# construct the full path to the training image, then
# grab the word ID from the path and use it to determine
# the integer class label
path = os.path.sep.join([self.config.IMAGES_PATH,"train", "{}.JPEG".format(partialPath)])
wordID = partialPath.split("/")[0]
label = self.labelMappings[wordID]


This path consists of three components:
1. The IMAGES_PATH where all our train, test, and val directories live.
2. The hardcoded train string which indicates that we are constructing a file path for a training
image.
3. The partialPath which is the sub-directory and base filename of the image itself.
We append the file extension to .JPEG to create the final image path. An example path can be
seen below:
/raid/datasets/imagenet/ILSVRC2015/Data/CLS-LOC/train/n02097130/n02097130_4602.JPEG

# update the respective paths and label lists
paths.append(path)
labels.append(label)
# return a tuple of image paths and associated integer class
# labels
 return (np.array(paths), np.array(labels))
 def buildValidationSet(self):
# initialize the list of image paths and class labels
 paths = []
 labels = []

 # load the contents of the file that lists the partial
# validation image filenames
valFilenames = open(self.config.VAL_LIST).read()
valFilenames = valFilenames.strip().split("\n")

# load the contents of the file that contains the *actual*
# ground-truth integer class labels for the validation set
valLabels = open(self.config.VAL_LABELS).read()
valLabels = valLabels.strip().split("\n")
# loop over the validation data
for (row, label) in zip(valFilenames, valLabels):
# break the row into the partial path and image number
 (partialPath, imageNum) = row.strip().split(" ")

 # if the image number is in the blacklist set then we
 # should ignore this validation image
 if imageNum in self.valBlacklist:
 continue

 # construct the full path to the validation image, then
# update the respective paths and labels lists
 path = os.path.sep.join([self.config.IMAGES_PATH, "val", "{}.JPEG".format(partialPath)])
paths.append(path)
 labels.append(int(label) - 1)

 # return a tuple of image paths and associated integer class
 # labels
return (np.array(paths), np.array(labels))

5.2.3 Creating List and Mean Files
r. At a high level, we will:
1. Build the training set.
2. Build the validation set.
3. Construct the testing set by sampling the training set.
4. Loop over each of the sets.
5. Write the image path + corresponding class label to disk.
Let’s go ahead and start working on build_imagenet.py now:
# import the necessary packages
from config import imagenet_alexnet_config as config
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from pyimagesearch.utils import ImageNetHelper
import numpy as np
import progressbar
import json
import cv2
# initialize the ImageNet helper and use it to construct the set of
# training and testing data
print("[INFO] loading image paths...")
inh = ImageNetHelper(config)
(trainPaths, trainLabels) = inh.buildTrainingSet()
(valPaths, valLabels) = inh.buildValidationSet()
# perform stratified sampling from the training set to construct a
# a testing set
 print("[INFO] constructing splits...")
split = train_test_split(trainPaths, trainLabels,test_size=config.NUM_TEST_IMAGES, stratify=trainLabels,random_state=42)
(trainPaths, testPaths, trainLabels, testLabels) = split
# construct a list pairing the training, validation, and testing
# image paths along with their corresponding labels and output list
# files
datasets = [("train", trainPaths, trainLabels, config.TRAIN_MX_LIST),("val", valPaths, valLabels, config.VAL_MX_LIST),("test", testPaths, testLabels, config.TEST_MX_LIST)]
# initialize the list of Red, Green, and Blue channel averages
(R, G, B) = ([], [], [])
define a datasets list. Each entry in the datasets list is a 4-tuple, consisting of
four values:
1. The type of split (i.e., training, testing, or validation).
2. The image paths.
3. The image labels.
4. The path to the output .lst file required by mxnet.
We’ll also initialize the RGB channel averages on Line 34. Next, let’s loop over each entry in
the datasets list:
# loop over the dataset tuples
for (dType, paths, labels, outputPath) in datasets:
# open the output file for writing
print("[INFO] building {}...".format(outputPath))
f = open(outputPath, "w")
# initialize the progress bar
widgets = ["Building List: ", progressbar.Percentage(), " ",progressbar.Bar(), " ", progressbar.ETA()]
pbar = progressbar.ProgressBar(maxval=len(paths),widgets=widgets).start()
# loop over each of the individual images + labels
 for (i, (path, label)) in enumerate(zip(paths, labels)):
 # write the image index, label, and output path to file
 row = "\t".join([str(i), str(label), path])
 f.write("{}\n".format(row))

 # if we are building the training dataset, then compute the
 # mean of each channel in the image, then update the
# respective lists
 if dType == "train":image = cv2.imread(path)
 (b, g, r) = cv2.mean(image)[:3]
 R.append(r)
 G.append(g)
 B.append(b)

# update the progress bar
pbar.update(i)
For each path and label, we write three values to the output .lst file:
1. The index, i (this is simply a unique integer that mxnet can associate with the image in the
set).
2. The integer class label.
3. The full path to the image file.
Each of these values are separated by a tab, with one set of values per line. A sample of such an
output file can be seen below:
0 35 /raid/datasets/imagenet/ILSVRC2015/Data/CLS-LOC/train/n02097130/n02097130_4602.JPEG
1 640 /raid/datasets/imagenet/ILSVRC2015/Data/CLS-LOC/train/n02276258/n02276258_7039.JPEG

4 977 /raid/datasets/imagenet/ILSVRC2015/Data/CLS-LOC/train/n04392985/n04392985_22306.JPEG

 # close the output file
 pbar.finish()
f.close()

 # construct a dictionary of averages, then serialize the means to a
 # JSON file
 print("[INFO] serializing means...")
 D = {"R": np.mean(R), "G": np.mean(G), "B": np.mean(B)}
 f = open(config.DATASET_MEAN, "w")
 f.write(json.dumps(D))
f.close()
To execute the build_dataset.py script, just execute the following command:
$ time python build_imagenet.py
[INFO] loading image paths...

To validate that your .lst files for the training, testing, and validation files were successfully
created, check the contents of your MX_OUTPUT directory. Below you can find the contents of my
MX_OUTPUT/lists directory (where I choose to store the .lst files):
$ ls /raid/datasets/imagenet/lists/
test.lst train.lst val.lst

Doing a line count on each of the files reveals there are 50,000 images in our testing set, 50,000
images in our validation set, and 1,231,167 images in our testing set:
$ wc -l /raid/datasets/imagenet/lists/*.lst
50000 /raid/datasets/imagenet/lists/test.lst
1231167 /raid/datasets/imagenet/lists/train.lst
48238 /raid/datasets/imagenet/lists/val.lst
1329405 total

5.2.4 Building the Compact Record Files
e command to generate the train.rec
file using mxnet’s im2rec binary:
$ ~/mxnet/bin/im2rec /raid/datasets/imagenet/lists/train.lst "" \
/raid/datasets/imagenet/rec/train.rec \ resize=256 encoding=’.jpg’ \
quality=100

As the output below demonstrates, converting the .lst files into packed record files is time
consuming as each of the ≈ 1.2million images needs to be loaded from disk, resized, and stored in
the dataset:
[17:25:21] tools/im2rec.cc:126: New Image Size: Short Edge 256
